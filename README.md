# Young-Tableaux
Generates Young Tableaux of order n

## Background
How many ways can we arrange n boxes into rows with row lengths in non-decreasing order?

This is what this program answers. Any such arrangement is known as a Young Tableaux.
They are a key object in combinatorics, representation theory, and algebraic geometry
